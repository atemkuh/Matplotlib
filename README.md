# Matplotlib
# The objective is to determine which drug is best suited for treating tumors in mice minimal effects from the following drugs ( Capomulin, Zoniferol, Stelasyn, Ramicane, Propriva, Placebo, Naftisol, Ketapril, Infubinol, Ceftamin)
# In order to achieve the above, the following activities need to be done:-

# Combine the two data files into a single dataset
# Check the number of mice.
# Find any duplicate rows with the same Mouse ID's and Timepoints, delete the duplicates.

# Get a summary statistics table of mean, median, variance, 
# find standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen.
# plot Bar and Pie charts showing the total number of datapoints for each drug regimen.
# Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment regimens
# Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.
# generate line and scatter plots
# calculate the correlation and regression
